Roundtable is a web platform connecting news, people and ideas.

## Installation

    virtualenv env --no-site-packages
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py syncdb

## Gimme a demo

Do `python manage.py runserver` and surf to http://localhost:8000/something/discover/

To log into the admin site, surf to http://localhost:8000/something/discover/ and login with `missmoderator` as both username and password.

## And for development?

Try `python manage.py runserver_plus` instead, to get the interactive debugger.

We're not using migrations yet, but there are fixtures available to prepopulate an empty database. To clean and update the database, run `fab reset`.
