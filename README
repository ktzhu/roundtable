# MoJo Hackfest 2011

Roundtable is a web platform connecting news, people and ideas.

## Installation

    virtualenv env --no-site-packages
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    fab update

## Gimme a demo

Do `python manage.py runserver` and surf to http://localhost:8000/how-can-we-make-hacktoberfest-even-better/resolve/

To log into the admin site, surf to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and login with `missmoderator` as both username and password.

## And for development?

Try `python manage.py runserver_plus` instead, to get the interactive debugger.

We're not using migrations yet, but there are fixtures available to prepopulate an empty database. To clean and update the database as well as installing any new dependencies, run `fab update`. You should do a preliminary `pip install -r requirements.txt` though, the first time you go through this process.
